"page_what_is_OPC_tool","","html","<p><strong>What is a PIA?</strong><p><p>A privacy impact assessment (PIA) is a risk management process that helps institutions ensure legislative requirements are met, as well as identify and manage the impacts their programs and activities will have on individuals&rsquo; privacy. First and foremost, conducting a PIA is a means of helping to ensure compliance with:</p><ul><li>legal requirements set out in the Privacy Act</li><li>the institution or program&rsquo;s enabling legislation</li><li>the requirements of Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) and Government of Canada policies and directives</li></ul><p>Programs and activities must comply with legal and policy requirements. The way they are designed should also incorporate best practices and minimize negative impacts on the privacy of individuals. For example, you should work to reduce the risk that an individual may suffer harm, such as identity theft, reputational damage, physical harm or distress, as a result of your program&rsquo;s handling of their personal information. A PIA may not eliminate such risks altogether, but should help to identify and manage them. There is often more than one way of designing a project. A PIA can help identify the least privacy intrusive way of achieving a legitimate aim.</p>",""
"page_what_is_OPC_tool","","html","<p>A PIA report documents the PIA process.</p>",""
"page_what_is_OPC_tool","","html","<p><strong>When is a PIA required?</strong></p><p>The TBS Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment outlines a number of requirements for a PIA, which you will see referenced throughout the e-Tool. A PIA is generally necessary if your program or activity may have an impact on the personal information of individuals. Specifically, the Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment requires that institutions conduct PIAs:</p><ul><li>when personal information may be used as part of a decision-making process that directly affects the individual</li><li>when there are major changes to existing programs or activities where personal information may be used for an administrative purpose (meaning as part of a decision-making process that directly affects the individual)</li><li>when there are major changes to existing programs or activities as a result of contracting out or transferring programs or activities to another level of government or to the private sector</li></ul></p>",""
"page_what_is_OPC_tool","","html","<p><strong>How can the PIA e-Tool help?</strong></p><p>The PIA e-Tool is a web-based form that guides users through completion of a PIA report. The e-Tool will prompt the user to consider, assess and manage the risks to privacy posed by the initiative, and to document remaining risks for review by senior management and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC). The e-Tool enables users to present the PIA process they have undertaken in a report that is systematic, logical, and efficient.</p><p>The PIA e-Tool will produce a PIA report that includes the following sections:</p><ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Program details and privacy analysis</li><li>Risk analysis</li><li>Risk mitigation action plan</li><li>Summary</li></ul></p>",""
"page_what_is_OPC_tool","","html","<p>In the process of conducting your PIA, you will likely need to seek out specific information on your program or activity or consult others before answering questions. Details may also become clear as your program is developed. To facilitate your PIA process you will be able to save changes in the e-Tool and return to your report later.</p>",""
